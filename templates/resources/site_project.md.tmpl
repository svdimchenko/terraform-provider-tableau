# {{.Type}} ({{.Name}})

{{ .Description | trimspace }}

Manages a project within a Tableau site. This resource allows you to create and manage projects with configurable permissions and ownership.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/resources/tableau_site_project/resource.tf" }}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

{{codefile "shell" "examples/resources/tableau_site_project/import.sh"}}

## Notes

- The `site` attribute is optional - omit it to use the provider's default site
- Changing the `site` attribute will destroy and recreate the resource (project will be removed from old site and created on new site)
- When no `owner_id` is specified, the project owner will be set to the authenticated user
- Content permissions control how permissions are inherited: `LockedToProject`, `ManagedByOwner`, or `LockedToProjectWithoutNested`
